# C++ Learning Journal

##Hello
I'm trying to learn C++. This repository is for that purpose only. If you need a code in it, be my guest to use any parts of it.
The codes that are published here only for my journal for the c++ journey.

##PS:
If you coincide with this rep and you think you can help me about something in my code please feel free to send a pull request.

Thank you for reading.
